1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is a JS library developed by Facebook designed to create user interfaces by using components.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

thinking in React means to break down a design into smaller reusable components

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

a Class component extends react and is where State or data is housed. You need to use the keyword 'this'. they render an object. Functional components used functions to complete tasks and return something. you can props in either but can only use State in classful components

4.  Describe state.

state is an object that houses our data. we dont actually change the data in state. we use setState to make any changes necessary in our application. state can only be used in classful components.

5.  Describe props.

Props are parameters passed inside functional components. it's how we pass data in an application. They cannot be mutated, we just receive them in components and use them to display data to the page.
